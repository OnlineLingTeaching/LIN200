<h1 id="how-to-grade-on-your-ipad">How to grade on your iPad</h1>
<p>These instructions are specific to D2L; other learning management systems may be different, although the basic idea is likely to be the same.</p>
<h2 id="on-your-computer-not-your-ipad">On your computer (not your iPad)</h2>
<p>The initial steps are best done on your computer, and not on the iPad directly.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Go to your assignment folder on D2L and first make sure that everyone has submitted PDF files and not Word files. If you have only a few Word submissions, it’s probably easiest to convert them yourself, but if you have quite a few, then you should select those students and send them an email requesting a PDF file not a Word file. I recommend you do this check very soon after the PSet is due, so that students have a bit of time to respond to your email.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you’re ready to download, follow the three steps shown below:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Choose “200 per page” to display all of the assignments</li>
<li>Click on the box that selects all of them</li>
<li>Click on the Download link</li>
</ul>

<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The download link will create a zip file which you download on your computer.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="D2LDownloadDialog.png" alt="Download" style="width:40.0%" /> </p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>Save the <code>.zip</code> file on your computer. Since homeworks count as “Student Records” for FERPA purposes, you should save these on your MSU One Drive folder, <em>not</em> in Dropbox or iCloud. If you haven’t installed OneDrive on your computer, you should do so beforehand.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you’ve unzipped the files you will see a folder (this is a Mac view, but the PC should be similar)</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="on-your-ipad">On your iPad</h2>
<p>This section assumes Notability and an iPad. If you are using another input method (graphics tablets), or another app for annotation, then you can skip this part.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>On your iPad, open Notability and import all of the PDF files that students have submitted, as shown below:</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Now grade each assignment as you normally would on paper.</p></li>
<li><p>When you are done grading them all, export them back to the same folder you downloaded them from.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="back-on-your-computer">Back on your computer</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Now back on your computer, re-zip the folder containing the graded assignments (make sure the folder has synced correctly.) On a Mac, you can do this by selecting the folder and choosing “Compress” from the File Menu (or Control-click/right-click). On Windows you may need a separate tool to do this.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>On D2L go back the the Assignments folder for that assignment.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose Add Feedback files</p></li>
<li><p>Now add the new <code>.zip</code> file of the graded assignments. You should see the following dialog box:</p></li>
</ol>
<p><img src="D2LUploadDialog.png" alt="Upload dialog" style="width:40.0%" /> </p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Once you have uploaded the feedback files, you also need to Publish them, using the Publish Feedback link:</li>
</ol>
